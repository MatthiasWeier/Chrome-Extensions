# PayWall Bypass Extension

## Overview

The PayWall Bypass Extension is a Chrome extension that redirects the current tab to a paywall-free version of the page using archive services. 
This extension helps you access content without paywalls by appending the current URL to an archive service URL.
This is a simple extension that uses https://archive.ph to bypass PayWall. <br>

## Features

- Redirects the current tab to a paywall-free version.
- Generates the current timestamp dynamically to ensure fresh links.

## Tested

I have tested this with a few websites. This code is everything but perfect; it works for some websites and for some not. If having difficulties, you can always still use this website: [https://paywallreader.com](https://paywallreader.com).

## TODO

- Make it more usable for more websites.
- Add better exception handling.
- Make it more pretty :)
- Feel free to make changes!
